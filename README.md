# EMMA: Enrollment Modules Management Assistant

## Overview
EMMA (Enrollment Modules Management Assistant) is an chatbot designed to revolutionize course enrollment in higher education. Our goal is to address the common challenge faced by students who often enroll in courses without a strategic plan, leading to suboptimal academic progress and experiences. EMMA leverages advanced Large Language Models (LLM) and personalized recommendation algorithms to guide students in making informed and strategic decisions about their course selections.

## Problem Statement
Many students in higher education institutions face difficulties in selecting courses that align with their academic goals, interests, and career aspirations. The lack of strategic planning in course enrollment can lead to a less efficient academic journey and missed opportunities. EMMA aims to transform this process by providing personalized, data-driven course recommendations.

## Solution
EMMA is a chatbot that interacts with students to understand their individual needs, preferences, and academic contexts. By integrating LLM with a sophisticated recommendation model, EMMA suggests the best classes for each student to enroll in each semester. This personalized approach ensures that students' course selections are aligned with their academic and career objectives, optimizing their educational experience.
